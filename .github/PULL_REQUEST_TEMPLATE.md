- [] Project name conforms to the naming convention described [here](https://github.com/Spirent/iTest-assets/blob/master/README.md)
- [] Project name is unique within the repository
- [] Project exists in the appropriate directory based on its category and class, e.g. Libraries/DUTs/Community
- [] Project can be imported into an iTest workspace without displaying problems or errors
- [] Project contains a file called documentation/readme.txt with metadata necessary for the [catalog](https://developer.spirent.com/). The readme.txt file must contain these 4 lines at the top of the file:  
      Project: Name of project  
      Description: 80 or so characters describing the contents of the project  
      Category: ("library" | "automation" | "framework")  
      Class: ("Community" | "Tested by Spirent" | "Reference"). 
        
     Other info like user instructions, a description of the intended use case, etc. can be added to the readme.txt after the 4 required lines.  
     _**Note:** A README.md file will be automatically generated including everything in the readme.txt file and a list of files, QuickCalls, and procedures with info from iTest's documentation fields. Do not create a README.md file, it will be overwritten. For the best possible documentation, fill out the description fields in each test case, procedure and QuickCall._
