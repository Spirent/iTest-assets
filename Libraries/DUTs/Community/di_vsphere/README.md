### getSnapShotList
query a specified virtual machine for a list of all snapshots related to that VM.  This functionality does not exist in the VMWare module for iTest as of 4.4, so we use the pysphere module.

Argument | Description
------------ | -------------
serverName | hostname of the vcenter instance.  This shouldn't be required, but since we're calling out to a python script, we have to do it.
username | login username
password | password.  Duh.
vmName | name of VM to query for snapshots
threadSession | the session name must be a variable so that the procedure is threadsafe.  If there is more than one open step with the same session ID, an error will be thrown.<br><br>This argument only needs to be passed in when it is called in a thread
### revertToNamedSnapshot

serverName | hostname of the vcenter instance.  This shouldn't be required, but since we're calling out to a python script, we have to do it.
username | login username
password | password.  Duh.
vmName | name of VM to query for snapshots
targetSnapshotName | 
threadSession | the session name must be a variable so that the procedure is threadsafe.  If there is more than one open step with the same session ID, an error will be thrown.<br><br>This argument only needs to be passed in when it is called in a thread
### deleteNamedSnapshot

### revertVm

vmName | Name of the VM to manipulate; the parent of the snapshot
targetSnapshotName | name of the snapshot to revert to.  By default, we revert to the snapshot named "baseline"

### snapshotVm

Argument | Description
------------ | -------------
vmName | VM to snapshot
snapshotName | name of new snapshot
### waitForVM

Argument | Description

### revertAndStartVm
